Specifically  the error occurs at line 802 when handling a unary-unary remote procedure call (RPC). The error propagates from line 802 to line 547  and then further to line 427. It ultimately leads to a type error at line 52 in the `serialize` function in the `common.pyx.pxi` file. The specific type error encountered is a `TypeError` which states that the `SerializeToString` descriptor for objects of type 'google._upb._message.Message' does not apply to a 'NoneType' object. It seems that some object being passed as an argument to `SerializeToString` is of type 'None' instead of the expected type. More investigation would be needed to identify the precise cause and resolution of this issue.

The error occurs during the execution of a query in a transaction.

The error originates from the traced_execution function in the dbapi module of the opentelemetry instrumentation library. This indicates that OpenTelemetry is being used for distributed tracing  and the error is likely related to database transactions being managed by the application. Further investigation and debugging of the code and transaction management would be required to resolve this issue.

The initialization process completes in 2 milliseconds. Following that  the logs indicate that the security filter chain is being applied to secure the GET request for the '/admin/users/' endpoint. However  the AnonymousAuthenticationFilter is being invoked  which suggests that the application is not accepting the user's credentials from the database. The logs also show that the request is being saved to the session and that the Pre-authenticated entry point is rejecting access. The same sequence of events occurs for the '/error' endpoint. The issue seems to be related to the authentication process and the LoadByUserName() method in the UserService  which is responsible for database-backed authentication.

Firstly  it states that tracing and profiling have been disabled  which is simply an informational message. Then  an error is reported where the system fails to retrieve the name of the cluster in which a pod is running. The error code received is 403  indicating a lack of permission or access. A similar error occurs when attempting to fetch the zone of the node where the pod is scheduled. Both errors involve connecting to the IP address 169.254.169.254 on port 80  suggesting a network connectivity issue. Finally  there is an information message indicating that a server has started on port 8080. In summary  there are issues with retrieving cluster and node information due to network connectivity problems  while tracing and profiling have been disabled  and a server has been successfully started.

This error typically occurs when a connection to the MySQL server is lost due to various reasons such as network issues  long idle time  or exceeding the timeout limit. When the server goes away  any ongoing SQL transactions are disrupted  and any further attempts to communicate with the server fail until the connection is reestablished. It is crucial to investigate the root cause of the server going away  potentially by checking the server's network stability  the configuration settings related to timeouts  and the database workload to prevent future occurrences of this error.

It then proceeds to secure a GET request to /admin/users/  but the AnonymousAuthenticationFilter is triggered  indicating that the credentials from the database are not accepted. The request is saved in the session and the access is rejected with a Http403ForbiddenEntryPoint. The same process is repeated for the GET request to /error. The issue seems to lie in the LoadByUserName() method in the UserService  which is responsible for database-backed authentication.

Firstly  there is a warning that the Temporary Store limit is set to 51200 MB  but the current store usage is 0 MB and the data directory only has 10207 MB of usable space. As a result  the system resets to the maximum available disk space of 10207 MB. Additionally  the logs mention that the ActiveMQ WebConsole and Jolokia REST API are available at http://127.0.0.1:8161/. There is another warning related to the /admin/ path  where a servlet exception occurs due to a JasperException. This exception is caused by the inability to set the last modified date for a specific file in the /tmp directory.
